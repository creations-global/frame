# Roadmap

- Create and maintain the ```frame``` component(s) inside this repository, using [bit.dev](https://bit.dev), thus nesting the component(s) files inside a sub-directory named ```frame```. It can be viewed and shared at https://bit.cloud/frame/frame.

- No other actions so far.

- One more unuseful entry, for practising NPM publication :)
