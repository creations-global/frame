Follow the syntax as used by BabylonJS, for example to install loaders:

```
npm install -D @babylonjs/loaders
```

In our case, with **Frame**, we could install its ```core``` as follows:

```
npm install -D @frame/core
```

then additional functionality (e.g. ```utils```):

```
npm install -D @frame/utils
```
